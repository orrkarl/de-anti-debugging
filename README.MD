# de-anti debugger: The Debugging Wars

So, I wanted to teach myself how to prevent someone from debugging my code. 
And here I am.

Each level will be tagged, and contain two projects: the debugger which solved the previous level (and a naive debugger for level0) and the debuggee which is the level's challenge. There are many different ways to solve those (as there are many ways to hide and detect a debugger), so progress doesn't have to be linear.
